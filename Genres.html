            <h2>Techno</h2>
            <p>
              Techno is a genre of electronic dance music known for its hypnotic
              rhythms, driving beats, and futuristic sounds. Originating in
              Detroit in the 1980s, it was heavily influenced by funk, electro,
              and futuristic themes, blending soulful grooves with machine-like
              precision. Techno is characterized by its repetitive 4/4 beat,
              minimalistic arrangements, and emphasis on synthetic textures.
              Artists like Derrick May, Jeff Mills, and Carl Craig were
              pioneers, shaping the genre into a global phenomenon. Today,
              techno thrives in underground clubs and massive festivals,
              continuing to push boundaries and captivate fans with its
              innovative and immersive soundscapes.

            <h2>House</h2>
            <p>
              House music is a foundational genre of electronic dance music,
              celebrated for its soulful melodies, uplifting rhythms, and
              infectious grooves. Emerging from Chicago in the early 1980s, it
              was inspired by disco and infused with drum machines,
              synthesizers, and basslines that made it perfect for dance floors.
              House music is characterized by its steady 4/4 beat, syncopated
              hi-hats, and repetitive yet dynamic structures. Legends like
              Frankie Knuckles and Larry Heard pioneered the genre, creating
              tracks that resonated with energy and emotion. Today, house music
              continues to evolve, spawning subgenres like deep house, tech
              house, and future house, while maintaining its status as a staple
              in EDM culture worldwide.

            <h2>Dubstep</h2>
            <p>
              Dubstep is an intense and bass-heavy genre of electronic music
              that emerged in the early 2000s in London, blending elements of UK
              garage, reggae, and drum and bass. Known for its signature
              wobbling basslines, half-time rhythms, and dramatic drops, dubstep
              creates a powerful, immersive experience on the dance floor.
              Pioneering artists like Skream, Benga, and Rusko helped define the
              early sound, while later acts like Skrillex popularized a harder,
              more aggressive style globally. Today, dubstep continues to
              evolve, pushing boundaries with experimental production and
              delivering adrenaline-pumping energy to fans worldwide.
